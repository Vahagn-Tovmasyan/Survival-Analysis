# Survival-Analysis
Report:
Here, survival analysis and CLV modeling revealed crucial insights into churn risk factors. Coefficient interpretation highlighted the impact of variables, with retiree status significantly influencing CLV. Valuable segments, defined by high CLV, include retirees and those without high school diplomas. Assuming data represents the population, annual retention budget estimation involves analyzing CLV, survival probabilities, and detecting at-risk subscribers. Recommendations for retention include active listening to customer feedback, exclusive perks for loyal customers, and addressing internet-related CLV concerns.
Contained within the primary script 'HW03_Vahagn_Tovmasyan_MA.py' are procedures for data preprocessing, encoding, the application of survival models (Weibull, LogNormal, LogLogistic, Generalized Gamma, Exponential), CLV calculation, and the derivation of insights and recommendations from the obtained results.
Insights and Discoveries: The examination reveals crucial elements influencing both customer churn and CLV. Particularly noteworthy is the substantial impact of the 'retire' variable on CLV, indicating opportunities for targeted marketing strategies aimed at specific demographics. 
Final Thoughts: Conclusions drawn underscore the significance of crafting personalized marketing strategies grounded in the insights gleaned from CLV scores and survival analysis results. 
Financial Planning: The script incorporates financial planning, encompassing calculations related to retention rates, costs, and annual budgets derived from the comprehensive analysis. Feel free to delve into the Jupyter notebook for an in-depth walkthrough of the analysis.
